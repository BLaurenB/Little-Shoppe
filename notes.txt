To Do:

Fix tests (meaning fix the application), and add tests to bring the coverage up to ___%

Other Tech debt: CSS in views (move to assetts),
security(check for secrets file, figaro, unneeded CRUD routes, else?). How do we decide to make decisions like changing the location of a redirect? just do it when you see it?
Address Pivotal tasks (break down into related and similar tasks or take whateverâ€™s in the queue)

Implement Multitenancy changes (new user roles, new store tables/relationships, new namespacing (controllers, routes, views)
